    <h2>Notes about the assumptions</h2>
        <p>Most research seems to indicate that people are most contagious in the 2 days before they start showing symptoms and then the day or
        2 after they have started showing symptoms. I use an estimate of 3 days in most of my calculations. </p>
        <p>The multiplier for how much cases are undercounted is the most difficult one to know. In this <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/coronavirus-live-updates/2020/06/25/883520249/cdc-at-least-20-million-americans-have-had-coronavirus-heres-who-s-at-highest-ri">article</a>,
        the CDC estimates we may be underreporting cases by a factor of 10. I use a factor of 5 in my calculations based on a couple of
        key pieces of information: one is that the case fatality rate is generally accepted to be about 0.8% to 1% of all cases of Covid-19
        resulting in death. If about 150,000 people in the US have died from Covid-19 (this is higher than the official toll because deaths
        are undercounted), then if that's 1% of the total number of cases it means 15,000,000 people in the US have actually been infected -
        about 5x more than the official count. Another piece of information comes from antibody tests from New York. In New York City, about
        <a href="https://www.360dx.com/infectious-disease/new-york-california-serology-studies-give-early-estimates-covid-19-prevalence#.Xwp_QShKiUk">1.8% of the population tested positive for Covid-19 at one point</a>, 
        but 14% of the population later tested positive for antibodies.
        This is over 7 times higher than the official case count. That amount of undercounting seems shocking, but when cases surge,
        it becomes increasingly difficult to get tested, and even when cases are not surging, we need to account for access to 
        testing, the expense of getting tested, and the presence of mild or asymptomatic cases who never get tested.</p>
        <p>You are welcome to play with these multipliers, but that's why I use the ones I use.</p>
